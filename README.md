## The artist network

This is my first project in Flask done for a Python/SQL course.  
  
The main objective was to build a functional app which will enable music artists to find a band which suits their preferences,
to create and join an interesting music events etc.  
  
The design of the app is based on bootstrap template, but front-end was not a main objective of the project.
